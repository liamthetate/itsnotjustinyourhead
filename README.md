# IT'S NOT JUST IN YOUR HEAD

![INJIYH LOGO](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoyMDB9/patreon-media/p/campaign/4727103/75d6e901f87e4096934daaaafdf538c1/1.PNG?token-time=2145916800&token-hash=M9ZnfHdxsTTjbBRGotAMLpRWavI-OTeQTir92vpWkP8%3D)

I am an audio editor and social media manager for a weekly [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-not-just-in-your-head/id1508932075) by two therapists (+ guests) about Mental Health and Capitalism. The podcast aims to raise awareness that mental health issues aren’t just a problem of the individual but symptomatic of systemic problems.

As one has no real choice but to live in (or under) Capitalism, the podcast also needs money to operate - lol - and whilst we have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/itsnotjustinyourhead) page and visibility on all the major podcast platforms, this new website will function as another point of entry for potential supporters.

## Design
<br/>

Colour Scheme

* Taking a cue from the standard [Apple Podcasts page](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-not-just-in-your-head/id1508932075), I used a white background and grey/dark text with a generous use of negative space.

* I used a custom red, a hex value I took from the [Patreon branding page](https://www.patreon.com/brand), to glue the 'call-to-action' buttons to the brand. 

* I have taken inspiration from the flame on the [podcast poster image](assets/images/podcast-cover.jpg) and used a yellow/orange colour on a few instances:
    - The logo/icon in the top left
    - On 'hover' events when using the navigation bar
    - The listen/subscribe button
    - The five star rating

* Hopefully this yellow/orange colour creates a sense of 'brand' identity and continuity across the interaction. That the five star rating shares a similar colour may also have the subtle effect of aligning the concept of quality with the 'brand'.

<br/>

Typography
* The 'Mate SC' font was used to replicate the poster image font in the navigation bar and 'Mate' was used on the hero image heading and on the hosts names.

* The main font is 'Roboto' ('if it ain't broke' etc) with Sans Serif as the fallback.

<br/>

Logo/Icon
* In the wireframes I used a flame icon but once I applied colour it ended up looking like the Tinder logo! So the nav icon is the computer symbol for 'adjust' or contrast, meaningful! Also the circlular nature ties into the globe on the poster image.

<br/>

Wireframes
* Desktop - [Home](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop1.png), [Episodes](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop2.png), [About](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop3.png), [Contact](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop4.png)
* Mobile - [Home](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile1.png), [Episodes](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile2.png), [About](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile3.png), [Contact](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile4.png)

# FEATURES

## Navigation: Desktop

![nav](assets/images/readme_images/nav_desktop.png)
The desktop navigation bar sticks to the top of the page throughout the users experience, this is particularly important as at any point they can push the call-to-action button.

## Navigation: Mobile

![nav](assets/images/readme_images/nav_mobile.png)
I didn't want the navigation to be hidden inside a 'burger' menu so choose to lose the 'title' and 'support us' button (and opt for a top banner instead) leaving space for the navigation names to be displayed.
<br/>
<br/>

## Landing page

![landing page](assets/images/readme_images/home_desktop.png)

Quite quickly you get a summary of what the podcast is about, a testimonial, a way to listen/subscribe and the option to support the podcast.
<br/>
<br/>

## Episodes

![landing page](assets/images/readme_images/episodes_desktop.png)
There are a few design decision going on here, so i'll go through them one by one:
<br/>
<br/>

- **Patreon**
![locked](assets/images/readme_images/patreon_locked.png)
- The black box at the top is my attempt to recreate what one sees when browsing any given Patreon page, [locked content!](assets/images/readme_images/original_patreon_locked.png)

- I've used a red small badge, using the Patreon brand colour, and listed various perks as a preview for what a user might read on the Patreon page. 

- Given that there are already quite a few instances of the support button on the page, I decided not to put one below the bullet points and saved it to act as a book-end to the episode section. 
<br/>
<br/>

- **Free episode**
![free ep](assets/images/readme_images/free_episode.png)
- This follows the same design format but whilst the locked content has a small red badge, this has a monochromtaic badge informing the user that it's free. Hyperlinks have been differentiated from the main text with a black colour.
<br/>
<br/>

- **Free playlist**
![playlist](assets/images/readme_images/episode_playlist.png)
- Placing the support button alongside the full list of free episodes is an attempt at reciprocity: 'here, have all this free content, it would be great if you could give something back in return' etc.
<br/>
<br/>

## About
![playlist](assets/images/readme_images/about.png)
I've used the same heading font for their names to tie it to the podcasts title branding. I'd like to add more details to this in time but for now this is all the hosts supplied.
<br/>
<br/>

## Contact
![playlist](assets/images/readme_images/contact.png)
Fairly standard contact form lol
<br/>
<br/>
## Footer
![playlist](assets/images/readme_images/footer.png)
The footer is sticky and displays throughout, the social media presence of the podcast is important for generating new listners and potential supporters, hence it is in a prominant place.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## First Time Visitor Goals:
    
    * I want to quickly understand the sites purpose and to listen/subscribe.

The header/hero sums up the site, with quick and easy access to listen. Information about the hosts is there.

    * I want to navigate the site, effortlesslly, to find content.

The single page design allows quick and easy use.

    * I want to be assured that this is a trustworthy operation, I want access to others opinions/reviews and the social media feeds to see what others are saying.

The header review, the links to apple podcast (and their reviews) and the social media links are all there within one our two clicks/taps.


## Returning Visitor Goals:

    * I've decided I want to support the podcast, so want that to be obvious how I do that.

The links are everywhere lol

    * I want a quick way to get in contact with the hosts.

Contact form

    * I want to find social media links.

Right there

## Frequent User Goals:

    * I want to search different topics/episodes I might not have listened to.

Currently the user can scroll the embedded playlist but there is room for expansion here.

    * I want to stay up-to-date about the podcast, website etc.

The social media links will do this but a newsletter might serve the user better.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# FUTURE EXPANSION

Rather than a playlist of all the episodes, I would like to embed each episode seperatly and then dynamically load them based on the users navigational behvaiour. Why?

Because on Patreon each episode has an extensive written description and links to articles, organisations and guests social media. I’d like to include that information next to each embedded episode, with the user having the option to expand or contract to read.

Having this data on the site, coupled with a search and filter capabilty to quickly find relevant topics, will improve the value to the user. 

A free mailing list for events, website updates etc could also be of value to would-be patrons.

<br/>

## Validator testing

HTML: No errors were returned in my code passing through the W3C validator, however [it did not like the official Spotify iframe embeds](assets/images/readme_images/html_spotify.png) but there isn't much I can do about that! 

CSS: No errors were found when passing through the Jigsaw W3C validator.

## Known bugs

1. I'm aware that using the header tag would be good semantic use of HTML however, if the nav was inside the header, the nav would not stick to the top of the page. For this reason I commented out the header tag.

2. In the episodes section, the embedded spotify episode has some text beside it. Depsite a considerable amount of time trying to figure it out, I couldn't center-align the text without it breaking the 'p' and 'a' sections into five columns. So instead I used an inline display property and settled to have it left-aligned on mobile.
