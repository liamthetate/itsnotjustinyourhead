# IT'S NOT JUST IN YOUR HEAD

![INJIYH LOGO](https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoyMDB9/patreon-media/p/campaign/4727103/75d6e901f87e4096934daaaafdf538c1/1.PNG?token-time=2145916800&token-hash=M9ZnfHdxsTTjbBRGotAMLpRWavI-OTeQTir92vpWkP8%3D)

I am an audio editor and social media manager for a weekly [podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-not-just-in-your-head/id1508932075) by two therapists (+ guests) about Mental Health and Capitalism. The podcast aims to raise awareness that mental health issues aren’t just a problem of the individual but symptomatic of systemic problems.

As one has no real choice but to live in (or under) Capitalism, the podcast also needs money to operate - lol - and whilst we have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/itsnotjustinyourhead) page and visibility on all the major podcast platforms, this new website will function as another point of entry for potential supporters.

## Design
<br/>

Colour Scheme

* Taking a cue from the standard [Apple Podcasts page](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-not-just-in-your-head/id1508932075), I used a white background and grey/dark text.

* I used a custom red, whose hex value I took from the [Patreon branding page](https://www.patreon.com/brand), to glue the 'call-to-action' buttons to the etablished brand. 

* I have taken inspiration from the flame on the [podcast poster image](assets/images/podcast-cover.jpg) and used a yellow/orange colour on a few instances:
    - The logo in the top left
    - On 'hover' events when using the navigation bar
    - The listen/subscribe button
    - The five star rating

* Hopefully this yellow/orange colour creates a sense of 'brand' identity and continuity across the interaction. That the five star rating shares a similar colour may also have the subtle effect of aligning the concept of quality with the 'brand'.

<br/>

Typography
* The 'Mate SC' font was used to replicate the poster image font in the navigation bar and 'Mate' was used on the hero image heading and on the hosts names.

* The main font is 'Roboto' ('if it ain't broke' etc) with Sans Serif as the fallback.

<br/>

Wireframes
* Desktop - [Home](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop1.png), [Episodes](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop2.png), [About](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop3.png), [Contact](assets/images/readme_images/wf_desktop4.png)
* Mobile - [Home](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile1.png), [Episodes](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile2.png), [About](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile3.png), [Contact](assets/images/readme_images/wf_mobile4.png)

# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## First Time Visitor Goals:
    
    * I want to quickly understand the sites purpose, listen/subscribe and learn about the hosts.

The header/hero sums up the site, with quick and easy access to listen. Information about the hosts is there.

    * I want to navigate the site, effortlesslly, to find content.

The single page design allows quick and easy use.

    * I want to be assured that this is a trustworthy operation, I want access to others opinions/reviews and the social media feeds to see what others are saying.

The header review, the links to apple podcast (and their reviews) and the social media links are all there within one our two clicks/taps.


## Returning Visitor Goals:

    * I've decided I want to support the podcast, so want that to be obvious how I do that.

The links are everywhere lol

    * I want a quick way to get in contact with the hosts.

Contact form

    * I want to find social media links.

Right there

## Frequent User Goals:

    * I want to search different topics/episodes I might not have listened to.

Currently the user can scroll the embedded playlist but there is room for expansion here.

    * I want to stay up-to-date about the podcast, website etc.

The social media links will do this but a newsletter might serve the user better.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# FUTURE EXPANSION

Rather than a playlist of all the episodes, I would like to embed each episode seperatly and then dynamically load them based on the users navigational behvaiour.

On Patreon each episode has an extensive written description and links to articles, organisations and guests social media. I’d like to include that information next to each embedded episode, with the user having the option to expand or contract to read.

Having this data on the site, coupled with a search and filter capabilty to quickly find relevant topics, will improve the value to the user. 

A free mailing list for events, website updates etc could also be of value to would-be patrons.

# TESTING

The site was tested on the following devices with no problems.

Device | OS | Browser
-------|----|---------
iPhone 8 | iOS 14 | Safari, Ghostery, Firefox 
Macbook Pro | Big Sur | Safari, Firefox, Chrome
Huawei P8 Lite | Android 6.0 | Firefox & Default Internet Browser
Samsung Galaxy Tab A | Android 6.0.1 | Firefox & Samsung Internet Browser

<br/>

## Validator testing

**HTML:** No errors were returned in my code passing through the W3C validator, however [it did not like the official Spotify iframe embeds](assets/images/readme_images/html_spotify.png) but there isn't much I can do about that! 

**CSS:** No errors were found when passing through the Jigsaw W3C validator.

## Known bugs

1. I'm aware that using the header tag would be good semantic use of HTML, however for some reason, if the nav was inside the header, the nav would not stick to the top of the page. For this reason I commented out the header tag.

2. In the episodes section, the embedded spotify episode has some text beside it. Depsite a considerable amount of time trying to figure it out, I couldn't center-align the text without it breaking the 'p' and 'a' sections into five columns. So instead I used an inline display property and settled to have it left-aligned on mobile.
