It’s Not Just In Your Head

I am the editor and social media manager for a podcast called 'It’s Not Just In Your Head', a weekly discussion by two therapists (+ guests) about mental health and Capitalism. 

The podcast and website aims to raise awareness that mental health issues aren’t just a problem of the individual but symptomatic of systemic issues.

As one has no real choice but to live in (or under) Capitalism, the podcast also needs money to operate - lol - and whilst we have a separate Patreon/Anchor page and visibility on all the major podcast platforms, the website will function as another point of contact for potential supporters.

In the long term I’d like to be able to update this site with a search engine and filter options, so users can quickly find a relevant topic discussed.

The website hopes to ‘feel’ like a reassurance that a listeners money would be well used.

Perhaps a listener would be supporters would like to discover a little more information about the hosts before backing on Patreon etc.
